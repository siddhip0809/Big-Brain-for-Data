# Big Brain for Data

A knowledge base ("the brain") covering the data center industry: companies,
people, private investors, and the relationships that connect them —
built for research and sourcing work.

## How this works (no coding required)

You don't need to open or edit any files yourself. You talk to Claude in
plain English — "add this company," "who invests in Company X," "show me
everyone we know at Company Y" — and Claude reads and updates the files in
this repository on your behalf. Every change is tracked in git, so nothing
is ever silently lost or overwritten.

## What's in here

- **`data/companies/`** — one file per company (data center operators,
  builders, service providers, etc.)
- **`data/people/`** — one file per person (executives, engineers,
  candidates, contacts)
- **`data/investors/`** — one file per investor or fund (private equity,
  venture capital, infrastructure funds, etc.)
- **`data/relationships.json`** — the connections between all of the above
  (e.g. "works at," "invested in," "board member of")
- **`docs/schema.md`** — a plain-English description of what information
  each type of entry holds
- **`sources/`** — raw notes, pasted articles, or text that specific facts
  were derived from, kept so every fact can be traced back to where it
  came from

## Status

This is the initial pilot structure with **example/placeholder entries only**
(clearly marked `example-`). No real company, person, or investor data has
been loaded yet.
